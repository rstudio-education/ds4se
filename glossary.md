# Glossary

Sometimes the biggest barrier to learning is the jargon that people use.
Here's a glossary of some terms from software engineering, statistics, and data science
so that you can tackle interesting problems
instead of being hung up on language.
If something isn't here, it's not you: it's us.
Please let us know what terms are missing or what definitions are confusing
and we'll do our best to fix them.
